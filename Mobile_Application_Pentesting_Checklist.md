# üì± Mobile Application Pentesting Checklist

A comprehensive checklist to guide mobile application security testing for Android and iOS platforms.

---

## üîç Static Analysis

- [ ] Decompile/reverse the application binary (APK/IPA)
- [ ] Analyze manifest/plist files for sensitive info or misconfigurations
- [ ] Review exported components (Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, Content Providers)
- [ ] Check for hardcoded secrets, API keys, credentials
- [ ] Analyze code for insecure crypto usage
- [ ] Analyze code for insecure data storage
- [ ] Check for use of dangerous permissions
- [ ] Check for obfuscation and anti-reversing measures
- [ ] Analyze package manager metadata (dependencies, versioning, source)
- [ ] Analyze third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Search for commented out code or debug code

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Dynamic Analysis

- [ ] Intercept app traffic with a proxy (Burp Suite, mitmproxy)
- [ ] Check for certificate pinning
- [ ] Test SSL/TLS implementation
- [ ] Perform runtime instrumentation (Frida, Xposed, Cycript)
- [ ] Analyze IPC mechanisms for unauthorized access
- [ ] Test app behavior with root/jailbreak access
- [ ] Observe app behavior during network changes
- [ ] Inspect logs for sensitive data leakage
- [ ] Analyze runtime permissions requests
- [ ] Test for insecure webview implementations

---

## üîê Authentication & Session Management

- [ ] Test login/logout functionality
- [ ] Check session token management
- [ ] Evaluate biometric authentication security
- [ ] Test for session fixation and token reuse
- [ ] Check for insecure password storage
- [ ] Test social login / OAuth flows

---

## üì° API and Backend Communication

- [ ] Check for unauthorized API access
- [ ] Test for IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
- [ ] Validate input handling on APIs
- [ ] Check response for sensitive data exposure
- [ ] Test for rate-limiting and throttling
- [ ] Check JWT validation and configuration
- [ ] Evaluate backend authentication/authorization mechanisms

---

## üíæ Local Data Storage

- [ ] Check SharedPreferences/UserDefaults
- [ ] Analyze SQLite databases
- [ ] Inspect files stored in internal/external storage
- [ ] Test caching mechanisms
- [ ] Verify clipboard data handling
- [ ] Test for keychain/keystore misuse

---

## üì≤ Platform-Specific Checks

### Android
- [ ] Analyze `AndroidManifest.xml` for misconfigurations
- [ ] Review intent filters
- [ ] Test broadcast receivers
- [ ] Check for exported components without permission checks
- [ ] Analyze `adb` logs for sensitive information

### iOS
- [ ] Review `Info.plist` settings
- [ ] Test URL schemes for hijacking
- [ ] Check for `Keychain` misuse
- [ ] Inspect `NSUserDefaults`, `.plist` files, and file system
- [ ] Test app behavior under jailbroken conditions

---

## üß™ Additional Testing

- [ ] Perform fuzzing on app input fields
- [ ] Test for insecure deep linking
- [ ] Perform binary patching
- [ ] Check for insecure app update mechanisms
- [ ] Check clipboard access and data leakage
- [ ] Evaluate background services and broadcast listeners

---

## üì¶ Package Manager and Dependency Analysis

- [ ] Enumerate used libraries from `build.gradle`, `Podfile`, or other manifest files
- [ ] Identify third-party SDKs and libraries
- [ ] Check for outdated or vulnerable libraries
- [ ] Verify integrity of fetched dependencies
- [ ] Analyze transitive dependencies for vulnerabilities

- [ ] ---
