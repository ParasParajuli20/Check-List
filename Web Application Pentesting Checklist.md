# üõ°Ô∏è Web Application Pentesting Checklist

A structured checklist to guide your web application penetration testing process. Use this as a baseline and expand as per your target and scope.

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Engagement

- [ ] Define scope (domains, apps, endpoints)
- [ ] Sign NDA and legal authorization
- [ ] Identify test environment vs production
- [ ] Determine testing timeframes and contacts
- [ ] Determine which tools are allowed (e.g., automated scanners)
- [ ] List third-party services in scope/out of scope

---

## üß© Reconnaissance

### Passive Recon
- [ ] WHOIS lookup
- [ ] DNS enumeration (`dig`, `nslookup`, `dnsenum`)
- [ ] Subdomain enumeration (`Amass`, `Subfinder`, `Assetfinder`)
- [ ] Google dorking
- [ ] Public breach/data leak search
- [ ] Social media profiling (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

### Active Recon
- [ ] Port scan (`nmap`, `masscan`)
- [ ] Service detection (`nmap -sV`)
- [ ] Directory brute-forcing (`ffuf`, `dirsearch`)
- [ ] URL fuzzing
- [ ] JS file scraping (find endpoints, secrets)
- [ ] Analyze robots.txt, sitemap.xml

---

## üîê Authentication & Session Management

- [ ] Test for default credentials
- [ ] Brute-force login (rate limit, CAPTCHA, 2FA)
- [ ] Session fixation
- [ ] Session timeout
- [ ] Secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- [ ] Token predictability
- [ ] JWT token validation (alg=none, signature validation)
- [ ] Logout and invalidation behavior

---

## üì§ Input Validation & Injection

- [ ] XSS (reflected, stored, DOM-based)
- [ ] SQL Injection (classic, blind, time-based)
- [ ] Command Injection
- [ ] SSRF
- [ ] LDAP Injection
- [ ] Host header injection
- [ ] Template Injection (SSTI)
- [ ] HTML Injection
- [ ] CRLF Injection

---

## üîÑ Access Control

- [ ] IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
- [ ] Vertical privilege escalation
- [ ] Horizontal privilege escalation
- [ ] Forced browsing of admin endpoints
- [ ] Check RBAC/ABAC policies

---

## üì¶ File Uploads

- [ ] Upload bypass (extension, MIME type)
- [ ] Check for RCE via file upload
- [ ] Path traversal on file uploads
- [ ] Antivirus/extension spoofing
- [ ] Client-side validation bypass

---

## üîó APIs & Backend

- [ ] Test API endpoints (Swagger/Postman)
- [ ] Check for rate limiting
- [ ] Authentication & authorization
- [ ] Mass assignment
- [ ] Parameter tampering
- [ ] GraphQL introspection & injection
- [ ] Mobile API endpoints

---

## üßæ Business Logic Issues

- [ ] Bypass payment flow
- [ ] Order manipulation (price, quantity)
- [ ] Misuse of coupons or discounts
- [ ] Unauthorized actions through race conditions
- [ ] Infinite money bugs / resource abuse

---

## üîê Encryption & Security Headers

- [ ] HTTPS enforced (HSTS)
- [ ] SSL/TLS version check
- [ ] Check for secure headers:
  - [ ] Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
  - [ ] X-Frame-Options
  - [ ] X-Content-Type-Options
  - [ ] Referrer-Policy
  - [ ] Permissions-Policy
- [ ] Check for sensitive data exposure (in transit/storage)

---

## üîÅ Client-Side & JavaScript

- [ ] Check for sensitive data in JS
- [ ] JS source map leakage
- [ ] DOM XSS
- [ ] Clickjacking
- [ ] Open redirects
- [ ] WebSocket testing
- [ ] CORS misconfiguration

---

## üß™ Automation Tools (Use Responsibly)

- [ ] Burp Suite / ZAP
- [ ] Nuclei (custom templates)
- [ ] Nikto
- [ ] Wfuzz / ffuf
- [ ] SQLMap
- [ ] XSStrike / Dalfox
- [ ] Subdomain takeover tools
- [ ] JWT Cracker / JWK tools

---

## üìù Reporting

- [ ] Categorize issues (severity, CVSS)
- [ ] Provide PoC and impact
- [ ] Remediation guidance
- [ ] Screenshots or video evidence
- [ ] Final review with client/stakeholder
- [ ] Retest if requested
